  Think about module dependencies and source-level conflicts than can arise.
  We don't want the programmer to have to organize sources in the call to
  "atto" such that all dependencies are met (in any case, we aren't guaranteed
  that the module dependency graph is a DAG, therefore topological sort doesn't
  hold).

  Move "Core.Utils" to the root. In "Core" we should only hold things visible
  in the language, not host specific stuff.

  There is too much copying going around. A mechanism shoul be in place
  for coping with this. There are only so many mutable like operations
  happening. We could implement usage counters and only modify when
  strictly necessary. Also, environments should be better managed. Every
  function in existance shouldn't have a copy of the whole environment.
  Massive sharing is possible here. Maybe not in Python, though.

  Make builtin functions "Callable" agnostic. They should work on any
  callable object, with the caveat that most operations raise an exception
  on "BuiltIn" objects.

  The "apply" function in  "Func" is very similar in function to what
  happens when we "interpret" a call to a "Func" object. We should merge
  the two functionalities (the "interpret" routine should call "apply"
  after it has evaluated all the arguments).

  Change argument order so that all order arguments are first, followed
  by all named arguments.

  Add filters to arguments. These should be one argument functions,
  which we associate with a specific argument and which return either
  "#T" or "#F". When the function is invoked, each parameter has the
  specific filter executed and we raise an exception if an "#F" is
  obtained. This is flexible type-checking. As an example, consider:

    que := [x@(is-number) y@(is-array)=1|2 (...)]

  This would produce:

    (que 10 1|2|3) => ...
    (que Hello 1|2|3) => Exception ...

  Add optional arguments. These should have a mandatory default value.
  They can't be filled by order/positional arguments when calling, but
  must be explicitly specified by the caller as a named argument. For
  example:

    que := [x y z=10? (+ (x) (y) (z))

  Would produce:

    (que 10 20) => 40
    (que 10 20 30) => Exception ...
    (que 10 20 z=30) => 60

  This will help mightily for complex functions with variable arguments.

  In "Interpreter.interpret", if we evaluate a function and the type of
  its body is not "Parser.Call" - that is, it is an data type, we evaluate
  the object as well. We'll need to upgrade the definition of an "Func",
  but we'll get a nice speed bonus for constructors and the like.

  Fix syntax issues with '=',':','+','*'. We should treat '+' and '*' as
  normal symbols and let them be part of other symbols. If in the argument
  list of a function, we find at the end of the last argument either '+' or
  '*' we interpret it as a vararg. We won't treat '+' and '*' as separate
  lexemes though. '=' and ':' won't be treated as symbols anymore though and
  they will have to have just a fixed meaning.

  Add default arguments for functions. The form should be:

    que := [x y=20 (+ :x :y)]

  This would produce

    (que 10 30) => 40
    (que 10) => 30
    (que y=30) => Exception ...

  Make auto-argument parsing when executing a script. We define a boot
  function and, depending on its arguments, generate appropriate getopt
  calls.

   que := [x y=30 debug (...)]

  Then, assuming we have to invoke "atto" as the interpreter command,
  we'd get:

   ./atto -boot=que -x 30 -y 100
