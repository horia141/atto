  Fix syntax issues with '=',':','+','*'. We should treat '+' and '*' as
  normal symbols and let them be part of other symbols. If in the argument
  list of a function, we find at the end of the last argument either '+' or
  '*' we interpret it as a vararg. We won't treat '+' and '*' as separate
  lexemes though. '=' and ':' won't be treated as symbols anymore though and
  they will have to have just a fixed meaning.

  Add default arguments for functions. The form should be:

    que := [x y=20 (+ :x :y)]

  This would produce

    (que 10 30) => 40
    (que 10) => 30
    (que y=30) => Exception ...

* [30.05.2011-xx.xx.xxxx]
  Make auto-argument parsing when executing a script. We define a boot
  function and, depending on its arguments, generate appropriate getopt
  calls.

   que := [x y=30 debug (...)]

  Then, assuming we have to invoke "atto" as the interpreter command,
  we'd get:

   ./atto -boot=que -x 30 -y 100
