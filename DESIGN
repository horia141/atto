* Values everywhere: One thing which we should take care to avoid when
  designing the language and standard library is using names where a value
  should be required. For example, in Tcl, thanks to the "upvar" and
  "uplevel" functions, you can do a lot of crazy - bordering on new
  syntax - things. This is required in Tcl. We should strive for a value
  oriented language. Whenever a function requires an object, a value
  should be supplied, instead of a Symbol, which, when looked-up in an
  appropriate environment, would produce the desired value. Functions
  similar to "upvar" and "uplevel" can easily be defined as BuiltIns and
  we need to take care they aren't and functionality like this is not
  used.
